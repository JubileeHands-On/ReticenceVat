Hey Riddle Middled..Look Want never Fiddles/Why I as Desire..Looms/On ever Me..just to see thee/As if not i atleast then My own/alas seer too own prone..
Real Real Pebbles..of Fog of Cerulean Dreamy Fables/I stuck at today's Chore..
Alas why relief is just in..Therefore..
Shifting sands of time or just to again be i'm/Hum?..
Why consciousness only true in own room..
illusion ran away with truth's groom..
halt all and more/where's concrete pointer to me or Eh all too semaphore..
Blurred got look hope to find truth..
I then means Phantom of Moot..
Ash then means I found No TRUTH!..
Ash means I found No Truth/As I means Phantom of Moot..
